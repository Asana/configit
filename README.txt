configit
    by Kris Rasmussen

== DESCRIPTION:

The purpose of this gem is to make it very easy to consume configuration files
and define them.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Easilly define config attributes directly on the class
* Provides validation of configs
* Automatically converts attributes to the correct type
* Enables you to access attribute values as attributes on the class instance
* Load config from files, strings, or IO
* Can turn on or off ERB evaluation before loading from yaml
* Treats strings / symbol keys as equivalent from yaml config

== SYNOPSIS:

  class MyConfig << Configit::Base
    attribute :foo, :required => true
    attribute :bar, "Some description", :type => :integer, :default => 10
    attribute :log_level, "Set the log level", :default => :debug, :type => :symbol
  end

  config = MyConfig.load_from_file("/etc/myconfig")
  
  config.foo
  config.bar
  config.log_level

  config.foo = "new value"

  config.valid # true or false
  config.errors.each do |error|
    puts error.message
    puts error.attribute.name
  end
